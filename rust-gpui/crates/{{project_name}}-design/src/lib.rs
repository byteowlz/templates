//! byteowlz design-system mechanism for gpui-kit.
//!
//! Implements the target-agnostic `design-system/spec/` (base24/16 slots,
//! closed role layer, proportional radius, base16 policy) for GPUI. The
//! reusable thing is the **mechanism** — base24 scheme (data) -> abstract
//! `Role` -> a gpui-component `ThemeSet` JSON document — not any one look.
//! Ship your own scheme JSON; this crate only resolves it.
//!
//! This is the candidate for `design-system/impls/gpui-rs`: it holds no gpui
//! types (the adapter emits JSON), so it can move there unchanged.
//!
//! - [`scheme`] parses a scheme file (the only layer a look fills).
//! - [`roles`] resolves the 16 closed `Role`s against a scheme.
//! - [`radius`] is the single-dial proportional scale.
//! - [`theme_set`] emits a gpui-component theme set from a scheme + identity.
